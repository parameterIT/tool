## BYOQM _(Bring Your Own Quality Model)_

This tool provides the possibility for developers and/or businesses to configure a specific software quality model directly into a flexible and modular Software Quality Assessment Tool.

The BYOQM tool allows for quick implementation of new metrics and is fully customizable from the low-level metrics measured in the actual source code to the high-level aggregation formulas that depict the overall _quality_ of the source code.

The following wiki pages will highlight the process of going from idea to metric and show concrete examples of implementing a Quality Model that fits.
