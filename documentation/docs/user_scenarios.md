# Purpose
This project was made as a part of our education, and is therefore developed as an open source project for academic purposes. Part of this process has been the researching of different tools, and thereby understanding how these tools are used in the real world. For the purpose of engaging other individuals in the further development of this tool, we have come up with two different user scenarios of how our tool could be used. 

## Potential monetization of _Modu_ through consulting
_Modu_ could potentially be used as a consulting tool for personalizing quality models for customers.
By parameterizing quality models users can define their own models and thus better understand how their work is evaluated.
This in turn means that consultants can provide quality models that measures the metrics that customers find relevant.
Specifically, we imagine an iterative dialogue between a customer and a consultant until an appropriate quality model is developed and improved on through recurring reviews.
Tweaks to the quality model could include: Whether to have remediation cost or not, moving metrics to different aggregations, or the removal of metrics that the customer found irrelevant for their project.

## Everyday users of _Modu_
Another use-case for the tool could be for software companies or developers in general.
As already established, a lot of SWQATs don't allow users to change their quality model only configure specific values, meaning if one isn't satisfied with a SWQATs quality model, one would have to find another SWQAT more suited.
Using the modu framework, these software companies could define their own quality model.
This will allow developers to view the quality of their software determined by what they value.
