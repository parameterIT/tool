## Plugin style system
The core essence of this tool is to provide a plugin-style tool in which a user can pick and choose which parameters the code is analyzed upon. This also means that the calculations made within these metrics are completely transparent, leaving no doubt in regard to what is actually being measured. 

The compositions of different metrics and aggregation formulas are then in turn created into what is referred to as a Software Quality Model. 

Configuring these models with transparent measured metrics and user-defined aggregation formulas allows developers and businesses to create a better approximation of actual software quality.
